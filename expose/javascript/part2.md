1. What will happen at line 12 and why? If the code causes an error, explain why.
It prints '3', which is the last value of 'i' after the forloop above it was done

2. What will happen at line 13 and why? If the code causes an error, explain why.
It prints '150', the value of 'discountedPrice' after the last iteration of the forloop

3. What will happen at line 14 and why? If the code causes an error, explain why.
It prints '150', the value of 'finalPrice' after the last iteration of the forloop

4. What will this function return? Give a brief explanation why. If the code causes an error, explain why. 
It returns an array of all the final prices after the discount was applied to all of them individually.

5. What will happen at line 12 and why?  If the code causes an error, explain why. ^^^ (assume this function is being called like the others: discountPrices([100, 200, 300], 0.5)). 
It returns an error (since it tries to pull the value of 'i' that was declared in a different block above it)

6. What will happen at line 13 and why? If the code causes an error, explain why.
It returns an error (since it tries to pull the value of 'discountedPrice' that was declared in a different block above it)

7. What will happen at line 14 and why? If the code causes an error, explain why. ^^^
It prints '150', the value of 'finalPrice' after the last iteration of the forlool. The reason this one works is because the 'finalPrice' is declared in the same block.

8. ^^^ What will this function return? Give a brief explanation. If the code causes an error, explain why. ^^^
It still returns an array of all the final prices after the discount was applied to all of them individually.
